                  <p>I’m a results-driven professional with a Bachelor’s degree in Management and a diverse background in leadership, 
                    systems implementation, and strategic planning. Over the years, I’ve built my career around empowering teams, driving 
                    operational excellence, and delivering impactful solutions. My journey has taken me through leadership roles in 
                    customer-focused environments and operations management, where I developed strong skills in strategic planning, 
                    team collaboration, and problem-solving.</p>

                  <p>In my leadership roles, I focused on mentoring teams and creating environments where individuals could thrive, innovate, 
                    and contribute to shared goals. I worked to drive performance, build strong customer relationships, and optimize processes 
                    to enhance overall efficiency and profitability.</p>
                  
                  <p>What I’ve come to love most in my career is the opportunity to solve problems, collaborate with diverse teams, and ensure 
                    that customer needs are met with excellence. This passion for problem-solving and collaboration led me to further my technical 
                    expertise by completing an intensive coding bootcamp, where I gained valuable skills that enhance my ability to innovate and 
                    optimize systems while continuing to add value to my customer-facing experience.</p>
                  
                  <p>Today, I bring a unique combination of leadership expertise and technical skills to my work as a software engineer. I am 
                    passionate about using agile methodologies to drive projects forward and create user-centric products that address complex 
                    challenges. My goal is to continue growing as an engineer while leveraging my background in strategic planning, leadership, 
                    and systems implementation to contribute to forward-thinking teams that prioritize both technical excellence and user 
                    experience.</p>

                  <h2>Management Style</h2>
          
                  <p>As a leader, I focus on empowering my team members and creating an environment where everyone feels valued and supported. My management approach is rooted in mentorship, where I actively listen, provide constructive feedback, and help my team navigate challenges. I believe in setting clear expectations and aligning team goals with broader organizational objectives to ensure we’re all working toward a shared vision.</p>
          
                  <p>Whether leading a team of engineers or customer-facing employees, I strive to create a culture of collaboration, transparency, and innovation. I encourage open communication, a growth mindset, and continuous learning. My goal is to help others develop their potential while driving performance and ensuring that both individual and team successes are celebrated.</p>

Whether working on backend systems or frontend features, I focus on delivering high-quality products that address user needs and business requirements.</p>
          
                  <p>Collaboration with other developers and stakeholders is crucial in my work. I enjoy pair programming, code reviews, and cross-functional team collaboration to ensure the success of projects and to continuously improve both code and process. I strive for excellence in both the technical and user experience aspects of development.</p>
